American politics can be a very passionate game and campaign managers will go to great lengths to have their candidate elected. Immigration stands to be at the forefront of today's issues. Using a data source concerning Boston's commuters and immigration, we will see if that is a good means to accomplishing political goals. A weakness of the model will be that the data is from a totally different state from a different region of the USA.
